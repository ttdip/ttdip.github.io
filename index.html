        <h2>Roses</h2>
        <p>Roses are so red<br>Violets do not go in shoes<br>This is a haiku</p>
        <p>This haiku was strongly influenced from the hundres of "roses are red, violets are blue" poems I have heard in my life.</p>

        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p>
            Bouldering is a form of climbing that doesn't use a harness or rope for protection. 
            That sounds dangerous at first until you find out that most bouldering doesn't go above 25 feet.
            There is one piece of safety equipment called a bouldering pad that is about 4 inches thick
            of padding that is placed at the bottom of the boulder in case you fall off.

            Ever since I was little I always had a love for video games. My first ever console was the super
            nintentdo and I remember playing an old cowboy game on there. With all of the technological 
            advances, I now play all my games on my laptop and I am looking to build a PC for an even
             better experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another hobby of mine is reading. Nobody else in my family loves reading like I do, I wouldn't even 
            say that any of them like it at all. I'm not sure how I gained this passion for books but 
            some of my oldest memories are ones of me reading and trying to read books that I thought
             sounded cool. Still to this day I read constantly and I'm always looking for a new book.
